- 👋 Hi, This is (Gaming With Autism) the begining of a non- profit organization, that was inspired by the passion of gaming through the skills and views of mental health. 
- 👀 We are interested in starting a community of players/gamers that live with Mental Health and give everyone a chance to play and compete in there own league. A league where their skills will reward them with prizes and money.
- 🌱 We are curently working on the non-fungible tokens (NFT) which will allow holders to be apart of both access in exclusive events and ownership of prgram where they can dicide and chose where donations and funds go to at mental health programs and organizations.
- 💞️ We are looking to collaberate with Mental Health Programs and Organzizations that allow Gaming to be apart of there schedule in order to increase performes and practice competitave gaming.
- 📫 How to reach us, is pretty simple our follower basis is pretty new and low so social media and email will be easy now.
